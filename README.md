# Complex - A Customized C++ Complex Number Library

**Complex** is a small, lightweight, and personalized C++ library that provides basic operations for complex numbers. Designed with simplicity in mind, this library is easy to integrate into your projects.

## Features

- **Simple Design:** A straightforward implementation of a complex number class.
- **Operator Overloading:** Supports arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using natural C++ syntax.
- **Stream Output:** Overloaded `<<` operator for convenient printing of complex numbers.
- **Customizable:** Easily extend or modify the library to meet your project requirements.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 (e.g., g++, clang, MSVC)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (optional, for building larger projects)
- Git (to clone the repository)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the Repository in your local folder:

2. Open folder in vs code terminal and run: " git clone https://github.com/KrishnaPrakash086/Complex_No._Library.git "

3. Create a Test Program: (e.g., main1.cpp) in the repository directory. This file will demonstrate how to use the library.

4. Run in the terminal : g++ main1.cpp -o main
